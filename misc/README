                              tplot

I have included the 'tplot' script in this release. This is a bash script for plotting
cross sections calculated by TALYS versus experimental data from the EXFOR database.
For this you need to download the 'exfortables' package and make sure that the
exfortables/ directory is placed in your home directory.

To test whether this works I suggest to go to the directory talys/samples/n-Pb208-xs/org 
and try (I assume that talys/ is in your home directory here, you may move the 'tplot'
script somewhere else)

~/talys/misc/tplot n Pb 208 nn

~/talys/misc/tplot n Pb 208 nn1

~/talys/misc/tplot n Pb 208 totlin -xsend 10000

~/talys/misc/tplot n Pb 208 082207

~/talys/misc/tplot n Yb 174 nn Ealways     (Ealways means always plot also if exp. data not available)

Simply giving the command ~/talys/misc/tplot will give you all the flags.

It is also possible to plot the latest world nuclear data libraries, but for that
you need to download the entire 'libraries' package, call it libraries/ and put
that in your home directory. The nuclear data libraries are then plotted when you add
the 'lib' flag to the above commands
