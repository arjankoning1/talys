Development of TALYS since release of TALYS-2.0

- December 29, 2023

********** Release of TALYS-2.0 **********

- February 8 2024

Solved a small bug in the metadata for ENDF MF and MT numbers in 
channelsout.f90.

- February 8 2024

Solved a small bug in the metadata for continuum inelastic, 
the printed level was wrong.

- February 10 2024

On advice of Caleb Mattoon, used underscore in multiple name headers 
in YANDF for easier parsing.

- February 11 2024

Made output files for gamma's much more descriptive by adding YANDF 
metadata in gammadecay.f90.

Solved a bug in angleout.f90 for the Legendre coefficient files.
Bug found by Caleb Mattoon. Some of the data sets were written twice.

Added an 'E' to discrete level output for assignment of energy level.

- March 2 2024

Added the D0 from completely theoretical calculations including 
confidence interval to the output of level density files. 
These can be used when no experimental D0 is available to constrain 
level density fits.

- March 11 2024

Provided the complete decay of a nuclear reaction into more structured 
YANDF output. Now, if 'population y' one obtains 'pop**.tot' files in 
which the complete decay of each nucleus is provided. This allows even 
more exclusive following of a nuclear reaction in terms of reaction 
probabilities.

- March 16 2024

Solved an output error, column headers were written out of phase for 
'components y', found by Zain Ul Abideen.

- April 16 2024

Added spin distribution to level density output.

- May 2 2024

Solved file opening error in gammapar.f for user-specified PSF files,  
found by Vetle Ingeberg.

- May 10 2024

Solved a problem found by Bryn Knight, an error in renumbering of the 
target level in case of half life equal to zero. 
Corrected levels.f90 for this. Removed the overwriting of the definition
of an isomer. If you specify a target level with half life zero, the 
isomer definition for the other levels stays intact.

- June 9 2024

Updated masses of neutrons up to alpha particles according to AME2020 
in constants.f90.

- June 12 2024

Corrected the photon transmission coefficients in tgamma.f90 for 
outgoing photons for presence of a quasi-deuteron component. 
This was done for incident photons but not for outgoing photons as 
discovered by Jinrong Liu.

- June 14 2024

Hope to have solved a problem for low energy (p,gamma) and (alpha,gamma)
cross sections by buiding in a Fermi function for complex-particle 
preequilibrium reaction at low energies. 
Found by Sotirios Charisopoulos.

- June 20 2024

Made some adjustments to the reading of external level densities as 
advised by Zain Ul Abideen, and added to the manual that 'flagparity y' 
needs to be set explicitly when external level density tables are read.

- June 30 2024

Added the possibility to have an OMP for the inelastic channel which is 
different from that of the incident channel. For example, for incident 
neutrons, 'v1adjust n 1.10' would change the OMP parameter V1 for both 
the incident and outgoing neutron channel, while these are not 
necessarily described by the same OMP (as the neutron emission is from 
an excited state). Now, it is possible to give e.g. 'v1adjust e 1.10' 
where 'e' stands for the ejectile that is equal to the projectile.
This changes the transmission coefficients for the exit channel but
not for the incident channel.

- July 12 2024

Changed default for older PSF's. For B-A and K-U, now strengthM1 2 is 
used, i.e. the RIPL-2 prescription. Hence, only modern PSF's for E1 
are accompanied by modern ones for M1. The recommended strength keywords
remain '8' and '9'.

- July 20 2024

Added the Pruitt et al OMP parameters for the KD03 global potential as 
an option. For this the 'pruitt' keyword has been added. The default is 
'pruitt n'. In addition, the keyword 'pruittset' allows to choose one 
of the 416 posterior OMP parameter distributions.

- July 21 2024

More YANDF output for pre-equilibrium and photon strength functions.

- August 19 2024

Changed weight in direct capture calculation in racapcalc.f

- August 20 2024

Added two more PSF models, strength 11 - D1M-Intra-E1 and 
strength 12 - Shellmodel-M1 

- August 29 2024

Solved an interpolation error in twkbint which led tot NaN for some 
fission transmission coefficients

- August 31 2024

Protected some character values for isomers going out of bounds when 
the number of isomers is beyond 10 (i.e. very short half lives). 
Problem found by Hamza Abboudi.

- September 15 2024

Generalized some equations in fstrength.f90 from incident neutrons to 
any incident particle, on the advice of Stephane Goriely.

- September 16 2024

Change in foldalpha, put abs() around beta2.

- October 24 2024

Changed default for printing emission spectra.

- October 25 2024

Corrected bug for isomers in the continuum after TENDL-2023 problems 
found by Jean-Christophe Sublet.

- October 26 2024

Added ndfit keyword.

- November 15 2024

Changed default of 'bestbranch' to 'n' after a finding of Pascal Romain 
that some important branching ratios were not correct. 
The tables in structure/levels/branch overrule the RIPL discrete level 
branching ratios to obtain a better description of isomeric cross 
sections. This means that by default there will be more emphasis on 
(adjusted) spin distribution of the level densities to obtain correct 
branching ratios.

- November 17 2024

Added a file structure/profile to the system. Here the user can put 
keywords which are ALWAYS enabled in the calculations. For example,
if you prefer the old way of having a very large TALYS output file 
with all the specific info printed in that output file, you may put 
'outall y' in that profile file so this will always be the case in 
your output. The TALYS keywords in structure/profile will automatically 
be added to the user input file.

- November 30 2024

Removed a divergence for knock-out reactions in knockout.f. 
When Emax is close to the Coulomb barrier, the denominator of the 
knock-out formula of Kalbach diverges. This was taken care of by 
putting a maximum of 1 (dE=1) in the denominator but this is now 
replaced by 100 (dE=10).

- December 7 2024

Made strength 8, QRPA model, for PSF the default.

- December 20 2024

Added two options for the Pruitt OMP, Democratic and Federal and 
changed the 'pruitt' keyword for that

- December 22 2024

Made the number of discrete levels, 30, the default for all 
residual nuclides.
